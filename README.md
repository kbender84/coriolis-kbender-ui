Coriolis RPG fx module for Foundry tabletop.

This module is heavily inspired (ripped-off) from lancer-weapons-fx
This module consists of two macro compendiums and relies on other modules to provide special effects for your Coriolis game.

I have prepared icons for all weapons in rulebook. To use them, go to coriolis-kbender-macros and run "Imakes Update" macro.
You need Coriolis Core Rules for it to run properly.
To use weapon FX you need to install additional assets packs:
-	sequencer
-	JB2A_DnD5e
-	animated-spell-effects
-	animated-spell-effects-cartoon
-	tokenmagic

Usage instructions in polish:
